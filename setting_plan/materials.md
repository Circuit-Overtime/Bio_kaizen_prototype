# Bio-Kaizen Smart Bin - Materials List

## **1. Computing & Communication**
- ✅ **Raspberry Pi 5** - Main processing unit for classification, token computation, and P2P communication.
- ✅ **Bluetooth Module (Built-in on Pi 5)** - For P2P communication with the user app.
- ✅ **LiDAR Sensor** - Detects user proximity & triggers lid opening.
- ✅ **TFT LCD Display (I2C Communication)** - Shows OTP, session details, and thank-you messages.

## **2. Sensors & Actuators**
- ✅ **Load Cell with HX711 Amplifier** - Measures weight change for token calculation.
- ✅ **Camera Module (Raspberry Pi Compatible)** - Captures images for waste classification.
- ✅ **Vacuum Mechanism** - Ensures touchless garbage intake.
- ✅ **Servo Motor (for Lid)** - Opens/closes the bin lid based on authentication.
- ✅ **IR Sensors** - Detects waste drop and prevents overfill.

## **3. Power & Energy**
- ✅ **Solar Panel (12V, 10W or more)** - Provides renewable power for the system.
- ✅ **Battery Pack (Lithium-ion, 12V)** - Stores energy for continuous operation.
- ✅ **Voltage Regulator (5V, 12V Step-down)** - Ensures stable power for Raspberry Pi & components.

## **4. Storage & Cloud Sync**
- ✅ **MicroSD Card (32GB or more)** - For OS and offline data caching.
- ✅ **User’s Smartphone (as Internet Bridge)** - Pushes bin data to the cloud when connected.

## **5. Mechanical & Structural Components**
- ✅ **Smart Bin Housing (Metal/Plastic Composite)** - Holds all components securely.
- ✅ **Separate Compartments (Bio, Non-Bio, Vermicompost Pit)** - Ensures proper waste segregation.
- ✅ **Hinges & Supports** - For mechanical stability of the lid and vacuum system.

## **6. Security & Authentication**
- ✅ **OTP System (Generated by Raspberry Pi)** - Ensures only the depositing user gets tokens.
- ✅ **Session Management (Cache & Timeout Handling)** - Prevents unauthorized access.

## **7. Miscellaneous**
- ✅ **LED Indicators** - Shows bin status (ready, processing, session ended).
- ✅ **Buzzer** - Provides audible feedback for interactions.
- ✅ **Cooling Fan** - Prevents overheating of Raspberry Pi during extended operations.
